I like the idea of taking something abstract (e.g. data from a SQL database) and turning it into custom made visualizations and asking data questions whether its in python or excel or whatever program....but if you're bogged down with meetings 50% of the time and the other half is you running SQL queries then I'm coming in disillusioned.

That doesn't give me a good idea of why its actually done, and what's being done in the big picture. So I'm gonna try to ask slightly differently.



* Is your day to day defined by working towards some big scope project (months, years) or do you typically do ad-hoc exploratory data analysis?

* Do you collaborate with data scientists in a way that you kind of funnel cleaned data to them? Like an employee pipeline for a lack of a better word

* Do you regularly involve yourself with knowing how the data is sourced (e.g. website clicks, hardware, sensors, etc)? Maybe that means going to factories, going to customers, etc.

* Do you regularly meet with people that consume your results, or are you often a  couple to a few steps removed from those who you analyze data for? 

* Do you experience quarterly/weekly crunch or do you find yourself pretty stress-free?  I'm coming from a relatively lax background...I don't know how I'd handle the impending doom that some people feel on a quarterly basis.

* Do you feel like your position is stagnant, or do you feel that being a data analyst allows you to diagnonally climb into similar roles (e.g. data analyst --&gt; scientist)",0.6,1,0,1,,2023-02-03T17:46:01Z,10sz5yn,t3

I'm working on a project. First I'm working on compiling data on the demographics of the audience we are looking to analyze. Two of the columns includes an advisor the clients are partnered with and the end date of the advising period. This seems to be what's causing me issues. The query I've constructed outputs something like the below:

&amp;#x200B;

This makes sense because one client (ID) can have multiple advisors and advising periods through their duration with us. For the purposes of my analysis, I only care about the most recent. My desired output would look like the following: 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h7hl3wemftfa1.png?width=297&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0a5efc59a9d40f0882d9a1e9618a3e41debefbc1

I've tried querying on the MAX(STAD\_END\_DATE), but that removes the NULLS which I don't want because it's also possible a client doesn't have an advisor and I want to include them as well. But if they DO have an advisor, I only want the most recent.

As of now, I have my data set ordered to where only the most recent advising date appears at the top for each instance of ID. 

My question is, is there some other way I can query on to eliminate prior STAD\_END\_DATE dates OR is there a trick in Python where I can iterate through my dataset and pull the first occurrence of each ID and eliminate the others?",1.0,8,0,8,,2023-02-02T12:11:20Z,10rwhep,t3

43,dataanalysis,How would I go about normalizing this European housing market data?,"Greetings!

I'm a newcomer to data analysis, so I apologize if my questions sound stupid to many of you. I want to visualize how the price-to-rent ratio has changed over time. The problem is the percentage is above 100, and I want to understand why the statisticians normalized it in this way, and what it exactly means. From the looks of the ratios, *everywhere* in Europe has an easier time renting than buying. I know that 1-15% means it's easier to buy than rent, 16-20% means it's easier to rent than buy, and anything above 21% means it's much easier to rent than buy. Can someone help me confirm from the dataset provided that this is either true or false?

Edit: It doesn't make sense to me when I look at this [dataset](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/digpub/housing/bloc-1a.html) and see that most people in Europe, whether they are in flats or homes actually own them.

I want an easy graphical way to enter records, so I can upload them, as I get new data. The only solution I can think of, is to enter data in csv files, and upload them.

## ""How do I get into data analysis?"" Questions

Rather than have 100s of separate posts, each asking for individual help and advice, please post your questions. This thread is for questions asking for individualized career advice:

-   _“How do I get into data analysis?”_ as a job or career.
-   _“What courses should I take?”_ 
-   _“What certification, course, or training program will help me get a job?”_
-   _“How can I improve my resume?”_
-   _“Can someone review my portfolio / project / GitHub?”_
-   _“Can my degree in …….. get me a job in data analysis?”_
-   _“What questions will they ask in an interview?”_

Even if you are new here, you too can offer suggestions. So if you are posting for the first time, look at other participants’ questions and try to answer them. It often helps re-frame your own situation by thinking about problems where you are not a central figure in the situation.  

## Past threads

-   This is the first megathread, so no past threads to link yet. 

## Useful Resources

-   Check out u/milwted’s excellent post, [Want to become an analyst? Start here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/10onhl2/want_to_become_an_analyst_start_here/)
-   A Wiki and/or FAQ for the subreddit is currently being planned. [Please reach out to us via modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/dataanalysis) if you’re willing and able to help. 
    

## What this doesn't cover

This doesn’t exclude you from making a detailed post about _how **you** got a job doing data analysis_. It’s great to have examples of how people have achieved success in the field.

It also does not prevent you from creating a post to _share your data and visualization projects_. Showing off a project in its final stages is permitted and encouraged.

52,dataanalysis,Announcement: Limiting Posts Related to Career Entry to a Monthly Megathread,"## Announcement

Hello Data Folks! 

In order to allow this subreddit to flourish and in order to better help everyone, we are now limiting career-entry (_“How do I get into data analysis?”_), resume-feedback (_“How can I improve my resume?”_), and certification (_“What course should I take?”_) questions, where the focus is on individualized advice, to a monthly megathread. Going forward, moderators will remove posts where the focus is general career-entry and resume-feedback for individuals, redirecting those making the post to the megathread. 

## Background &amp; Rationale

### Community Feedback

Six months ago, [we sought feedback on what to do with regard to questions focused on career entry](https://old.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/w20v9f/should_rdataanalysis_limit_how_do_i_become_a_data/) in this subreddit. The results were less clear-cut than we had hoped, with the subreddit’s participants split between continuing to allow _""How do I become a Data Analyst?""_ questions (42%) to various options for their discontinuance (58%). The top option among those favouring the discontinuance of _""How do I become a Data Analyst?""_ questions was to redirect them to a megathread.

In order **to sustain a healthy community** here, change is needed, even if some do not agree. Reflecting on that survey, in addition to many comments within as well as sent to modmail, we mods believe this is worth trying. No change is permanent, and we will re-evaluate the situation within the next 12 months. But we have reasons to believe it will help and will improve the subreddit for all participants.  

### Maintaining Balance

Many topics that are (or should be) central to r/dataanalysis are generally being drowned out by the high volume of **questions related to career-entry, training, and resumes**. The outcome is a kind of [“Eternal September”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September) effect — the influx of new and inexperienced participants asking basic questions — resulting in a perpetual reduction in quality of conversations and a shift of focus away from the subject itself as other matters become drowned out and diluted.

This subreddit isn’t the data analysis equivalent of r/cscareerquestions, but rather meant to fully be r/dataanalysis. We want everyone here to be able to enjoy this subreddit as a community which is relevant to them and their interest in the core of data analysis.

### Focusing Help

**This is not to say that either these questions or new and inexperienced participants are unwelcome; far from it.** We want to _include_ you. But inclusion should not result in the exclusion of others. And past practices here are not beneficial to you, either. Rather than 100 people asking the same or similar questions in separate places we want to bring you together to maximize the benefit. Separate questions reduce the benefit to those 100 different people because it dilutes the response and exhausts those who want to help! Many have suggested, “just search previous answers”, however [Reddit’s search function is underpowered to say the least](https://i.imgur.com/Oh2YlGa.gif).

The better answer is to concentrate and concatenate those questions. Additionally, having a monthly thread means that those who ask for help might not just have their question visible for a few hours. Your question will be in a thread which is pinned for a month and linked in subsequent months. 

We would ask that those with expertise or willingness to share ideas still drop by these threads to offer feedback. Welcome newcomers and offer advice! 

## What does this cover?

If you have a **question** or are **seeking out feedback** along any of these lines:

-   _“How do I get into data analysis?”_ as a job or career.
-   _“What courses should I take?”_ 
-   _“What certification will help me get a job?”_
-   _“How can I improve my resume?”_
-   _“Can someone review my portfolio / project / GitHub?”_
-   _“Can my degree in …….. get me a job in data analysis?”_
-   _“What questions will they ask in an interview?”_
    
… take it to [the megathread!](https://old.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/10r5f3f/megathread_how_to_get_into_data_analysis/)

Especially if the question is focused on you and your career, as an individual. 

## What this doesn't cover

This doesn’t exclude you from making a detailed post about _how **you** got a job doing data analysis_. It’s great to have examples of how people have achieved success in the field. Give lots of details while maintaining your privacy.

It also does not prevent you from creating a post to _share your data &amp; visualization projects_. Showing off a project in its final stages is permitted and encouraged.

## Future Plans

This is just a first step. There have been suggestions from community members that we should utilize Reddit’s wiki function to build a FAQ. If you are interested in helping to build that, [please reach out to us via modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/dataanalysis). And for other concerns as well, please [send comments to modmail](https://tenor.com/view/business-cat-working-cat-boss-angry-gif-13655998). We may not reply, but we will read constructive feedback and we are open to ideas.

I would like to begin to work with my IT department to set up a server with python available, so that I (or someone else on my team) could run a python script on the server.

* take a csv, do some stuff, provide an new csv/xlsx
* Use tabpy to allow use of python scripts in Tableau/Tableau Prep. We have a Tableau server.

My question: What exactly do I ask my IT department for?

I know I would want to be able to connect to this server in, say, vscode, write some scripts that include maybe a Streamlit interface to upload xlsx or csv files, and then use those files as data sources for my analysis, which i would then export into new xlsx and also perhaps display on streamlit. The idea of this is to allow other members of my team to use my python scripts without them having to install python.

I also want to be able to launch a TabPy server, or even better have one running all the time, that I can connect to from our Tableau Server.

But, I'm not sure what exactly to ask for.  Web Server? Can someone help me figure out what I'm trying to request?

I should add that I work remotely, at a somewhat big corporation, Microsoft everything. (except Tableau instead of Power BI, not sure why)

I graduated with a Bachelors degree in Finance, with a minor in Business Data Analytics. My first job was in medical underwriting - since then, I have transitioned to P&amp;C underwriting for a specialty product. I feel that growth is capped in this field unless I want to become a broker (which is a poor work life balance with a lot of travel).

I really enjoyed getting my minor in DA; if it has been available as a major when I enrolled I would have done it instead.

Now I am 26 looking to change careers, and am wondering what the best path would be. There aren’t a lot of opportunities at my current job to cross train those skills. I was thinking my options are the following:

-	Masters degree in analytics. This is the expensive option - but if it’s the only way, I can make it work.
-	taking courses online (boot camps, Google DA course, etc). Not sure how effective this option would be - I feel that I’d struggle vs other candidates with real job experience

Ultimately I want to shift into something that actually interests me and might be a bit more stimulating with a higher growth ceiling and more in demand skills while I am still young(ish). Any advice is greatly appreciated.

66,dataanalysis,"Straight quantities are useless, need to normalize!","A bit of a rant.  Ive been in quite a few different data roles throughout my 20+ years in data.  During those years, one of the biggest takeaways is that straight quantities that people use in their narrative or analysis are almost always useless in the context of comparing things.  For example:  oh my god, there are Teslas with their steering wheel falling off!  Someone may mention that there have been 5 incidents of this.  
  
Well, what can you deduce from that qty of 5?  Is that bad?  How does it compare to other automakers?  The answer is it is pretty much useless or not very informative.  That's where this concept of normalization comes to play.  Most times it is in the form of a ratio: parts per million, defect rate: # of defects divided by total population, per capita, etc.  With a normalized metric, like # of defects per car sold, we can answer those original questions, we can compare apples with apples so to speak.

67,dataanalysis,DataAnalyst.com - I launched a niche job board with hand curated data analyst jobs. Here's the summary of how it's going after the first month,"Hi all, 

on Dec 19th I launched [DataAnalyst.com!](https://DataAnalyst.com) - this is the first update (hopefully many more to come).

Want to make sure I document the journey, and keep myself honest, so each month I will be making a post about the statistics, progress, some thoughts and what are the next steps I want to be focusing on.


While the main purpose for the post is to bring everyone along on the journey, I do think that members of r/DataAnalysis might benefit from the site, especially those looking for a new job. 

I'd also love to engage with people on the sub who'd like to share their data analyst career journey. 

If it's not something that belong here, have absolutely no issues to take the post down and / or keep the updates to a different subreddit.

**Early stages vision** is to become the #1 job board for data analysts - hand-picking interesting data analyst job opportunities across industries.


Where I would like to see this going - my **long term vision**, is building a community of aspiring and professional data enthusiasts. A place for those who love data to collaborate, share, learn and develop their careers.


So, let's dive right in.


######**Statistics for January, 2023**

Number of jobs posted: 269 (United States: 208, United Kingdom: 45, Europe: 16)

Paid job posts: 0 (although currently, some jobs were featured free of charge as they coming from my ex-Google network)

Users: 795

Total ""Apply Now"" clicks: 634 (only data available for the last 3 weeks)

Avg. session duration: 3min 52sec

Pageviews: 4100

Avg. time on page:  1m 35sec

Returning visitors: 17.7%

Total Google Impressions: 410 


#General observations: 

- It's hard to find jobs with salaries - atrocious in Europe, US is better due to salary transparency laws in certain states, but even then we're looking at a range bigger than King Kong's first dump of the day 
- UK is much more ""Recruiter agency"" driven - most of the data analyst jobs are being posted by a 3rd party, rather than directly by companies' own HR.  
- As I'm hand picking jobs from various sources, noticed a lot of jobs which have had 100+ applicants are being reopened - what does that mean? Not enough quality candidates in those 100? Are companies just hoarding CVs?

###Thoughts: 
Overall I'm pretty happy about the progress so far, probably actually exceeding my expectations. Even though my initial announcement (19th Dec) mainly attracted my friends / colleagues, the site is getting some traffic through direct type-ins, Twitter and LinkedIn engagements. 

What is more important for me is that I can see visitors spending time on the site, clicking through job posts, and some are actually coming back to check out what's new. 

Something that's annoying me (and most likely also is annoying visitors to the site) is that currently the site is very much US focused, there's no doubt about that. Multiple factors in play - from agency postings in the UK, job being posted in local language, to absolute lack of salaries available in the EU. This obviously has a trickle down effect - imagine you're looking for a data analyst role in France, confirm your filters and you'll see one job - well, that might be an extra job you haven't applied yet, but if there aren't further quality enough listings being added over the course of the week, you'll extremely likely not to come back.

Could that be solved by posting jobs without a salary - yes, it probably could and it would definitely increase the amount of jobs posted for a certain country, on the other hand, I hate not knowing what the salary range is when applying myself. 

Another option would be only focusing on the US market in the initial stages, but I am really not sure how I feel about that.

The site is still extremely fresh, so will monitor behaviours for the first 3 months and make a decision then. 


#Things in the pipeline:

- Monthly Data Analyst jobs Hiring Insights - which industries are hiring, salary trends - watch out, January edition coming this week!
- The complete data analyst guide (how to become a data analyst, career path, responsibilities and skills...)
- Day of a data analyst (people in the industry sharing their journey)
- Launch the newsletter - honestly this should be much higher on my to do list, but really out of my depth to automate it
- Start reaching out to HR / job posters directly



######**So, there are 3 ways you could get involved:**

1. Looking for a new challenge? Check out the website - I'm adding new jobs daily

2. Looking to hire a data analyst to your team? Shoot me a message on Reddit (or alex@dataanalyst.com) and I'll upgrade your first listing for free!

3. I'm in early stages of creating a ""Day of a Data Analyst"" section - if you're open to do an email based interview about your data analyst career journey (and be one of the first featured), just send me a message and we'll organise something.

If you have any questions, concerns, come across glitches - please just reach out, happy to chat.

71,dataanalysis,Would you consider a Master's in Public Policy to be relevant education?,"People say it's a lot easier to break into this field if you have a related degree.

My coursework involved learning how to run regression models in STATA, clean a couple of types of data, ""tell stories"" about data in a succinct manner, and do some basic things in Tableau and geospatial mapping programs like ArcGIS and GeoDa.

The whole reason I'm interested in this field is from my internship, where I wrangled data about housing demographics across my state and distilled it for insights on a campaign for the nonprofit. I taught myself a bit of R and Python in that internship as well.

I'm a software developer with 5 years experience. 4 of those years were in aerospace composites process modelling - i.e. developing software that simulates the processes involved in manufacturing carbon fiber parts for spaceships and airplanes. A lot of what I did there involved doing stuff with data. I also have a science background, and some previous science-y work experience, that involved some data-y stuff.

I recognize this does not make me a data analyst or data scientist! But I've done some stuff that \*appears\* to match descriptions of some of the tasks that are part of data analysis.

I made a list of stuff I've done that sounds (perhaps naively) like data analysis. I would really appreciate any feedback you have on whether the stuff I did ""counts"", whether I can legitimately claim to have data analysis skills - and whether I should!

&amp;#x200B;

data collection

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data\_analysis#Data\_collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis#Data_collection)

\- I did this at \[groundwater scientist job\] (e.g. gathered hydrometric data from FortisBC, and put it into Excel), and programmatically at \[aerospace dev job\] (I think any time I wrote something that ""slurped in"" data from e.g. a csv file)

&amp;#x200B;

data processing

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data\_analysis#Data\_processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis#Data_processing)

\- I did this at \[groundwater scientist job\] ""by hand"" - organizing data into specific structures in Excel spreadsheets

&amp;#x200B;

data cleansing

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data\_cleansing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cleansing)

\- I did this at \[groundwater scientist job\] ""by hand"" in Excel: finding &amp; flagging missing entries, duplicate entries, outlier values (flagging outliers for reanalysis)

\- also did a bit of this programmatically at \[aerospace dev job\] - I remember detecting &amp; removing missing values (from NumPy arrays, or Pandas dataframes - I don't remember which)

&amp;#x200B;

data transformation

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data\_transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation)

\- I did lots of this at \[aerospace dev job\], programmatically (e.g. extracting certain ranges of data from a NumPy array or Pandas dataframe or one of our legacy data formats, and putting them into some other arrangement)

&amp;#x200B;

data modelling

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data\_modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_modeling)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data\_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model)

\- I did a little bit of this at \[web dev bootcamp\], \[ISP dev internship\] &amp; \[aerospace dev job\] (making ERDs, planning out database schemas).

\- Would this also include modelling e.g. plots &amp; plot data in classes &amp; attributes, like I did at \[aerospace dev job\] (when I developed the plotting module)? If so, I've done lots of data modelling

&amp;#x200B;

data visualization

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data\_visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization)

\- I visualized data by making charts &amp; graphs in Excel at \[groundwater scientist job\], and lots of other times for school (e.g. most lab writeups)

\- I did data visualization programmatically at \[web dev bootcamp\] as part of a demo project. At \[aerospace dev job\]... would it be more accurate to say I \*built tools for\* data visualization? I designed &amp; built the plotting module!

\- Oh also at \[chandelier warehouse logistics job\]! I did data collection, processing, cleansing and visualizing data - all in Excel

&amp;#x200B;

data analysis in general

\- I did get a little bit of formal training in data analysis, while getting my bachelor degree in physics. (That was a while ago though - I graduated from that university in 2007!)

  \- Intro to Statistics - would this count as statistical data analysis?

  \- Physics Tools: Experiment - data analysis is in the course description: ""The following experimental tools and techniques are explored: Instrumentation; Fourier series; Data analysis; building AC and DC circuits; Detection and production of ultrasonic, acoustic, visible, microwaves; Mechanical systems.""

  \- Computational Methods in Physics - computational/numerical data analysis, in Python: ""Topics include an overview of numerical analysis, the use of symbolic computation packages with applications to the modelling of physical phenomena, and the treatment of experimental or theoretical data""

Every time there’s a join between data sets, they doesn’t seem to verify their count of rows. I’ve shown them many ways how to… and the problem always pops up after a few weeks. 

Basically, when there’s like an order ID, item ID, and transaction ID, they always join for transaction information on the item or the order… so they end up with a few hundred million rows out of a couple million rows of data. Now, despite this they always figure out how to work around it on Tableau so you can’t catch it by validating data against the visualization (using count distinct and other things). 

I’ve tried like 5 times. Shown how to do a quick math that if you have 20,000,000 transactions, and 4 million customers and 200,000 items and the average order is less than 2 items… you’d be hard pressed to end up with much more than 30,000,000 rows and 40,000,000 is possible but unlikely. How to debug things and get it right.

I’m starting to think they’re just putting it on me to always get every join for them (even though our work is such you can’t escape joining data anymore and I can’t take on all the workload).

**Commonly Asked Questions –**

Q) Do I need a degree?

A) Its helpful. Many job postings for DA ask for a bachelor’s degree.

&amp;#x200B;

Q) Will the Google Data Analyst certificate from Coursera be enough to get me a DA job?

A) No. Not even close. The course teaches you some of the basic technical concepts of the industry and that’s about it. My feeling on the course is this – If you took the entire thing from start to finish and it didn’t scare you away, you may have a chance at this.

More on this certification -- It is marketed really well as being a potential game changer.  This cert gets asked about 10x more than any other.  Again, it is not a magical key to the industry.  It lets you peek in the door to see what you are getting yourself into.

&amp;#x200B;

Q) How do I transition from X field I am in today to become a Data Analyst?

A) See the list below for the tips on how to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

Q) I already have a degree in X, will that help me?

A) Depends on the position, the recruiter, and the company.  Most job postings show that they are looking for a degree in a related field -- Business, Statistics, etc.  The more relevant, the better your chances are that it will help.  Remember, a degree is just one part of an entire package you should have to help you transition into the field.

&amp;#x200B;

Q) What do I need to learn?

A) Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI or Tableau is a good place to start. I would also learn them in that order. From those, you can start branching out to learn more, such as SSRS, Azure, SAS, Looker, Alteryx, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Q) Do certifications matter?

A) Depends on the person doing the hiring. To some recruiters, it means you have at the minimum a basic knowledge set on the topic. To others, they may see them as useless throwaways that anyone spending 30 minutes on the Internet could get.

&amp;#x200B;

Q) Can I get a job right away?

A) Depends on your experience level.  If you are trying to break in from another career, its going to be difficult and like any job hunt, you will probably be passed up for those that are experience already.  Its going to come down to your knowledge of the field and how well you market yourself.  See #11 below.

\---------------------------------------------------

**Roadmap to break in to analytics:**

1. Build a Strong Foundation in Data Analysis and Visualization: The first step in starting a career in data analytics is to familiarize yourself with the basics of data analysis and visualization. This includes learning SQL for data manipulation and retrieval, Excel for data analysis and visualization, and data visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau. There are many online resources, tutorials, and courses that can help you to learn these skills. Look at Udemy, YouTube, DataCamp to start out with.
2. Get Hands-on Experience: The best way to gain experience in data analytics is to work on data analysis projects. You can do this through internships, volunteer work, or personal projects. This will help you to build a portfolio of work that you can showcase to potential employers. If you can find out how to become more involved with this type of work in your current career, do it.
3. Network with people in the field: Attend data analytics meetups, conferences, and other events to meet people in the field and learn about the latest trends and technologies. LinkedIn and Meetup are excellent places to start. Have a strong LinkedIn page, and build a network of people.
4. Education: Consider pursuing a degree or certification in data analytics or a related field, such as statistics or computer science. This can help to give you a deeper understanding of the field and make you a more attractive candidate to potential employers. There is a debate on whether certifications make any difference. The thing to remember is that they wont negatively impact a resume by putting them on.
5. Learn Machine Learning: Machine learning is becoming an essential skill for data analysts, it helps to extract insights and make predictions from complex data sets, so consider learning the basics of machine learning. Expect to see this become a larger part of the industry over the next few years.
6. Build a Portfolio: Creating a portfolio of your work is a great way to showcase your skills and experience to potential employers. Your portfolio should include examples of data analysis projects you've worked on, as well as any relevant certifications or awards you've earned. Include projects working with SQL, Excel, Python, and a visualization tool such as Power BI or Tableau. There are many YouTube videos out there to help get you started. Hot tip – Once you have created the same projects every other aspiring DA has done, search for new data sets, create new portfolio projects, and get rid of the same COVID, AdventureWorks projects for your own.
7. Create a Resume: Tailor your resume to highlight your skills and experience that are relevant to a data analytics role. Be sure to use numbers to quantify your accomplishments, such as how much time or cost was saved or what percentage of errors were identified and corrected. Emphasize your transferable skills such as problem solving, attention to detail, and communication skills in your resume and cover letter, along with your experience with data analysis and visualization tools. If you struggle at this, hire someone to do it for you. You can find may resume writers on Upwork.
8. Practice: The more you practice, the better you will become. Try to practice as much as possible, and don't be afraid to experiment with different tools and techniques. Practice every day. Don’t forget the skills that you learn.
9. Have the right attitude: Self-doubt, questioning if you are doing the right thing, being unsure, and thinking about staying where you are at will not get you to the goal. Having a positive attitude that you WILL do this is the only way to get there.
10. Applying: LinkedIn is probably the best place to start. Indeed, Monster, and Dice are also good websites to try. Be prepared to not hear back from the majority of companies you apply at. Don’t search for “Data Analyst”. You will limit your results too much. Search for the skills that you have, “SQL Power BI” will return many more results. It just depends on what the company calls the position. Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Visualization Specialist, Business Intelligence Manager could all be the same thing.  How you sell yourself is going to make all of the difference in the world here.
11. Patience: This is not an overnight change. Its going to take weeks or months at a minimum to get into DA.

Be prepared for an application process like this

100 – Jobs applied to

65 – Ghosted

25 – Rejected

10 – Initial contact with after rejects &amp; ghosting

6 – Ghosted after initial contact

3 – 2nd interview or technical quiz

3 – Low ball offer

1 – Maybe you found something decent after all of that

IRL I have a series of temperature sensors in a physical row. I want to visualize the relationship to each other and also change over time. So I think I want a 3D histogram or a heat map.  X-axis is time, y-axis is sensor array, z-axis is temperature (or color blocks would be ok).  

It's coming from a IoT setup, and right now it looks like JSON is the best way of moving the data from the field to the internet. I could be talked out of that. I'm currently sending it to Adafruit IO, I could be talked out of that too. 

Would you point me to a good destination platform for access and visualization? Ideal price is free, but I can pay a small subscription. Adafruit has visualizer but nothing like I want. Google Looker Studio has more options but not what I want. My skills include dragging and dropping and cobbling together code that other people wrote.  ;) so a full python solution on a private server is not going to happen.

I think there's plenty of time before we have to surrender our jobs to machines and live the rest of our lives on universal basic income.

But I do wonder if the recent focus on AI-- in particular, ChatGPT and other OpenAI software-- will cause some people who were pursuing(or think of pursuing) careers in data analytics/data science, to become pessimistic and go in a different career direction.

From what I can see, lots pf people were pursuing data analytics/science because there was all this talk of these fields growing massively over the next ten years or so.

Now I all of a sudden see a surge of talk about how data analysts are screwed and will be jobless in 5-10 years.

I'm leaning towards wanting to be a corporate finance analyst (looking at company financials, not investments) such as an FP&amp;A analyst but I've been having trouble knowing what to search for on LinkedIn and also being able to get a call back from employers

I recently completed my Google Data Analytics certificate from coursera and have completed a couple LinkedIn certificates. Some skills I have added to my resume are:

SQL, R programming, Tableau, MS Power BI, Basic python

and a couple more. However, my main issue is that I've been searching for a long time and have submitted my resume to many jobs with no call back. At the same time, many of these jobs that keep pulling up on LinkedIn aren't in the right field 

I'm trying to either find a data analytics or financial analyst job to start off.

Am I searching wrong ? Is it that I don't have my official degree yet ? Am I lacking some skills ? Is the market on these jobs low right now ?

Extra info: I'm currently a full time teller, I live in LV (so there's plenty of companies)

I'm hoping to make 60k starting because without my degree, i could easily make 50k by moving up in the bank without a degree and in my head I feel like I didn't go to school to make a salary I can get without a degree. At that point, I feel like school was a waste of time.

108,dataanalysis,What would you call my current position?,"Hello everyone. Long time lurker, first time poster. Happy to be here.

I wanted to get some feedback from the community on what exactly you would label my position as or feel comfortable putting on a resume as the title for my position.

Backstory: I came from a completely different field than Data but have always used Excel and Data Analysis to help myself at previous jobs. I was hired on at my current company in a Customer facing position but was recruited/promoted to what they have labeled as the ""Data and Business Analyst."" To be fair, I don't think they had any idea what I'd end up accomplishing. Within 6 months of the position change I was given a 60% raise which they attributes to two things:

1. My producing complete projects at high speeds.
2. Creatively finding answers to problems before they are requested of me. (Since I spent time on the Customer facing side I knew a lot of blind spots that could be fixed by someone in my position.)

Today my title is still ""Data and Business Analysis"" but here are a few of the projects I work on daily/weekly:
1. Use Python to scrape various databases and websites for contacts/potential customers
2. Combine Python and SQL to clean the scraped data then match it against our own Database. Find updates for existing and upload brand new data points.
3. Automatic and personalized email reports to our Sales team to help them identify new leads that are already in our platform
4. Automatic and personalized email reports to our Sales team to help them fill in the data gaps on their owned accounts.
5. Automated reports with Python querying SQL data then uploading it to Google sheets to report to the company our current/historical Financial standings
6. Another Python/SQL script that uncovers and uploads our data blind spots to the team so that they can work with their customers to fill the gaps.
6.1. I also use those same Data reports to find ways to automatically fill in the gaps for the ""No Brainer"" fixes.
7. More specifically I have a Python project that queries for missing Data points in our customer contacts then uses Selenium to open Chrome and attempt to scrape that data from the internet. So far that's been a fairly successful venture.
8. Another specific project I have worked on is again using an automated Python script to log into our payroll company's site, download the labor reports and upload them into our SQL server for further labor tracking projects.
9. And as always I query the odd ""Can we get a report on X for Y region"" from the Sales team.



So my question is: Would you guys consider this to still be ""Data and Business Intelligence Analysts""? Almost weekly I'm writing code to talk between data sources, our platform and third party applications. Most of the ""Analysis"" jobs I do are now automated with Python and Task Scheduler, which allows me the time to do all these other projects.

I want you guys to help me solve the following problem. So the thing is that I want to perform analysis on Bank's Deposits data. 

My data contains the following. 

Facts/Quantative information : 

Fact 1: Contains a number of accounts in a particular branch of a bank. 
Fact 2 : Total amount of a balance in a particular branch of a bank. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dimensions/Qualitative information :
- Bank's internal hierarchy is like this. 
Circle&gt;Network&gt;Region&gt;Module&gt;Branch

(Description:
Circle : Statename from where the branch is located
Network : 5-6 Network areas in one state area
Region : contains multiple regions in network area
Module : contains multiple modules in a regional area
Branchname : Last object of the hierarchy. )

Other dimensions : 
Facility: saving bank account, current account, term deposits (these are basically types of accounts of a customers)
Product: multiple banking related products are there
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is summarised data which shows the number of accounts and balance amount in a particular branch. There are total more than 30000 branches. And each branch entries are updated daily in a database 


I wanted to perform an analysis over this dataset. I've already done top 5 and bottom of all the criteria (like top 5 branches by account, amounts, products segments etc. ) Which pretty basic things. 

Suggest me some advance analytics/statistics techniques to get more insights from the data. 

Note : I've past four years of data from today's date. I'm using PowerBI as the business intelligence tool for analysis.

184,dataanalysis,How to show statistical significance for rates (percentages),"Hi all,

I have a data set which shows me whether a person accepted a training course, declined the course or there has been no response to it.

Within this dataset, among others, I have columns such as:

* Unique person ID
* Unique training course ID
* Course status (accepted, declined, pending)
* City (that they're based in)
* Age Range
* Profession (grouped by categories) 

The analysis I'm trying to do is to understand where we have the best and worst rates of people accepting the courses, and then will look to do further analysis on why this might be and how to improve this.

To do the analysis, I've essentially created a bunch of pivot tables in Excel that show my data in various ways: e.g accepted course % by age range, accepted course % by city, accepted course % by city AND age range (to see something like was there a higher rate for 18-24 year olds in LA vs New York).

I have a two part questions:

1) Is there a more efficient/better way to do this?

2) Now that I have got a list of %'s, split by different variables, how can I show if these are of any significance. The %s will vary based on sample sizes for each of the individual cuts and I could have a higher % for one cut simply by the fact that the sample size is so small and so individuals skew the % a lot, so it could be that this is not statistical significant.

My total sample size is of around 2k rows in Excel, but this gets smaller based on certain cuts I do.

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts/advice on how to take process to the next part of this would be very helpful.

196,dataanalysis,"(Personal Analysis, Not Official Study) Predicted U.S. State Covid-19 Mortality Rates from Age Demographics","I'm new to reddit and trying to honor the Rules of this Community, so hopefully I've marked things appropriately and am posting this in a reasonable place.  This is something I did in my free time, I found the results interesting, and thought others might be interested as well.  I used only publicly available information and am trying to be transparent in the methods used.

I'd love to hear feedback and suggestions on whether I've made any obvious mistakes or omissions.  I'm not aiming for high accuracy, just back-of-the-envelope, ballpark numbers to get an idea.  This is pretty simple from a Data-Analysis perspective, but it was laborious getting reliable/complete sources and making the data compatible with each other.  The most obvious thing I left out was taking Obesity into account, but I couldn't easily find data about the joint Obesity-Age distributions of all 50 States, whereas Age was available.

My data sources were:

* [Variation in the COVID-19 infection-fatality-rate by age](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02867-1/fulltext) \- Lancet article
* [2020 U.S. Census Results](https://data.census.gov/) \- U.S. government website
* [Social Security Actuarial Table](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html) \- U.S. government website

I'll provide the important steps here, but a full writeup of my analysis can be found at:

* [Covid-19: Predicted U.S. State Mortality Rates from Age Demographics](https://helpfuldatahacks.blogspot.com/2022/12/covid-19-predicted-us-state-mortality.html)

&amp;#x200B;

We keep seeing officials argue about whether their State's Covid Response was better or worse than other States, and they compare things like their State's number of deaths or mortality rates (deaths per million).  But comparing those numbers directly between States is only valid if the baseline expected mortality rates are the same across States.  Since Covid mortality rates are *highly* dependent on age, it seems like we should be taking that into account when deciding if some preventative measures were better than others.  My goal was to calculate the expected number of covid deaths in each State, taking into account each State's specific Age Distributions.

To do this I needed:

1. The Infection Mortality Rate for Covid-19 as a function of Age of the patient
2. Age Distributions for each of the 50 U.S. States

Then I could simply integrate (1) against (2) and arrive at a predicted number of deaths for each State.  Doing this will produce wildly pessimistic values for the number of covid deaths, because it assumes everyone was infected with the same strain at the same time, that vaccines never existed, and that zero preventative measures were taken.  But all of that is the point, to see what each State would expect based purely on their Age Distributions.

I found (1) in the Lancet article linked above.  It provides an Age-Dependent Mortality Rate for the original Covid Strain from 4/1/2020 - 1/1/2021, before Variants became widespread and before vaccines were readily available.  It examined data from multiple countries and combined their number of deaths with seroprevalence surveys to arrive at Mortality Rates that took untested and asymptomatic cases into account.

Determining (2) was trickier, because the Census only provides data in 5-year buckets, and it lumps everyone over 85 into a single bucket.  To turn this into a distribution with 1-year buckets that could be integrated against the Infection Mortality Rate I:

(A) Broke up the 85+ bin into 85-89, 90-94, 95-99, 100 bins

The best I could think of was to use the U.S. Actuarial Tables to see the likelihood of death from all causes for each age.  This isn't apples-to-apples because a State's Age Distribution can be completely disconnected from the Actuarial Tables (e.g. - Retirees might move down to Florida, resulting in a spike of people older than 60 that is in direct disagreement with the Actuarial Tables), but it was the best I could come up with.  I took the percentage of people in 85+ and filled in a table of percentages for every age from 85-100 by applying the Actuarial Death Rates starting from 85.  Obviously this will sum up to a value far greater than the original 85+ bin, so I then multiplied each value by the ratio:

(Original Value in 85+) / (Sum of all calculated values) 

This ensures that the sum of my newly created bins equals the original value in bin 85+.

(B) Broke up the 5-year bins into 1-year bins

I assigned (x,y) values based on the ""middle"" of each bin.  For x=Age I used the middle value, so if the bin was 0-4.9999 then I used a value of 2.5.  For y=Population I divided the population by the number of years in that bin.  Then I did a cubic spline to fill in all bins from Age 0-100.

&amp;#x200B;

With these steps done I simply integrated the two sets of values together and produced the following, in which I also provide the Worldometer number of covid deaths for each State as well as a column comparing the two.  It seems clear that the Age Distributions can have a large impact on the baseline expected number of deaths, with the highest State (Florida: 15,832 predicted deaths per million) being 85% higher than the lowest State (Utah: 8,553 predicted deaths per million).

I am on course to finish this program in a few weeks. I have little to no prior experience with data analytics and am in need of a career change (this part is very important, it is not for fun, it is essential due to my recent accident leading to a disability) A little background: I have been working in the retail/hospitality industry my entire working life. I have learned a lot about how retail and restaurant businesses work, inside and out, FOH, BOH, and everything in between. I discovered that I have a knack for spreadsheeting/excel and I decided to take that and explore it for this new career path.

What I am looking for is some helpful advice. I really don't respond to any negativity, as I have seen on other threads. I am determined to make this happen and will pursue this until it becomes a reality. 

After I complete the capstone, I have gathered that I will need to build a portfolio, work on cases, and networking via linkedin. I plan on furthering my SQL and Tableau knowledge with more online courses and the almighty YouTube.

I am however feeling a little discouraged about breaking into the tech world with no prior experience and no degree. What I do have is a ton of gumption and drive to be successful. I just don't know where to go after I complete this certificate.

222,dataanalysis,Thinking of Switching careers to Data Analytics,"  

Hello!

I was hoping to get some career advice as I'm looking to do a career switch and after working as IT support for a very long time (18+ years)

I quit my job as a System Administrator due to excessive stress that is directly affected/affecting my health about \~5 months ago. 

After this healing break, I was contemplating on going back to being a System Admin, but the nature of the job - unfortunately - is to be on call, work long hours, weekends, holidays etc.  - which I can't do anymore due to my health condition and almost no work/life balance.

Every recent interview I took requires this high availability.

After talking to friends, one of the suggestions was to switch careers and suggested Data Analytics/Science. Doing some research, this looks like something I can do and would enjoy.

Just a little background of my IT work experience:

\- Started off as Desktop Support and eventually got promoted to a System Admin about 6 years ago

\- Worked heavily on Active Directory, Hardware Inventory, VMWare, Storage, Backups, SOCs compliance, Azure/AWS, and more

\- Also worked with Identify Management, which gave me a little bit of experience with SQL queries (only queries)

\- Have advanced PowerShell/Batch scripting knowledge

My education is BS Business Administration (I know it doesn’t make sense).

Fortunately, I still have enough savings to stay unemployed for a few more months and study (free or paid) at the same time.

I’m definitely willing to start fresh even with starter salary and work my way up from there.

I was hoping you can advice the best or right way to start. 

Been reading about Google Analytics vs IBM courses and got confused. I don’t want to take the wrong path to what companies are looking for today (2023).

I also looked into schools that offer these short courses like Harvard, MIT, CareerFoundry, and more – ranging from $1500 to $10,000. I really don’t mind doing that if it will give me better chances on landing a job after completing the courses.

Apologies for the long post but anyone can advice the most recent and best way to start from scratch would greatly be appreciated.

I often see and comment on people's resumes for data analyst roles, and see different courses/certifications they have completed. I was wondering how do managers see these certifications/courses? Are there any hiring managers here that have a perspective on this, or preference for certain certifications?

I would think that the certifications from Microsoft and AWS are generally highly regarded? Courses are not required, there is just a comprehensive test of knowledge. Then Personal Projects on Github? Lastly, I was looking at other sites, and Coursera, Pluralsight, and LinkedIn Learning (Formerly [Lynda.com](https://Lynda.com)) are all about the same, to me at least, they are just courses with no official test and no final output.

All these options can be valuable in learning, but I'm curious how much weight they carry when a manager sees the same Covid Deaths project on a resume for the Nth time.

So like if student A said they took courses 1 and 2, and student B said they took courses 1, 2, and 3, the column for courses take wouldn’t match because it would say “1, 2” for the first student and “1, 2, 3” for the second.

I work for a government program as a data analyst reporting to the M&amp;E department and every time presentations are made it's my boss and his assistant MEL specialist who do them. 
There are times fellow PMOs including the overall program manager forget that I even exist. I feel so bad every time I am not given equal opportunity to express how I feel and even the recommendations I make on how we could improve reporting are not taken into consideration.
I remember the other day when I was called upon to speak, I mentioned something about the data quality and my supervisor called immediately after the meeting telling me I should have consulted him first. 

How can I go about this since I really love this company and the work culture around here.

It’s only my first week.

At the moment I only want to focus on one thing before moving on to the next one, I feel like it’s important to just get decent at one to move on next, otherwise you rush things and its all a mess. I really want to get pretty good at MS Excel. 

After feeling fine with Excel, I want to move on to SQL then PowerBi and Python, step by step. Meanwhile I could do online courses, read books, recently ordered a book for Excel beginners which I could read at my current work “which I hate”, before bed and in my free time in general. I love the fact that lot of online courses you can do at your own pace which would be perfect for my current situation. 
After feeling decent with all the software’s I feel like it’s time to do projects, do my portfolio and apply for jobs. 
So my questions are; which one of these software’s I should spend most time on learning?

263,dataanalysis,Advice for my department to better manage data,"I work in the finance department of a university. No one in our department knows database or anything outside Excel. Currently we rely 100% on Excel 2016 for all our data storage and calculation needs. We don't have any database or third party software to help us manage data.

I have encountered some inconvenience in my daily work. For example:

1. The department generates many transactions through several bank accounts on a daily basis. We have a cash manager who creates new, separate Excel files to store daily transactions. Therefore, if I want to know what contributes to the variances in cash flows between 1/1/2023 and 1/1/2022, I have to open two Excel files to compare. If I want to know the sum of cash inflows for the first week of January, I need to open 5 Excel files and sum them up. A much better/intuitive way would be like how we use our online checking account. In a graphical user interface you put in the dates and filters such as cash flow types, click a button and get the results. In my current process this is all step-by-step manual work with raw data through different Excel files.
2. Since the department relies 100% on Excel, we generate a lot of Excel files for different purposes. We do have a master Excel file which stores like 200 rows of financial data and ratios. However, a lot of the data comes from other sheets/files. For example, a certain cell's data is linked to another tab in the same Excel file. When you go to that tab, the data is linked to another Excel file. When you open that Excel file, the data is linked to another Excel file again. This makes the master file extremely complicated, hard to audit, and prone to human error. To get to the original source of a number, you need to trace through different Excel files.

Besides Excel 2016, we have Tableau 2020, but no one knows how to use it. Also, we care less about data visualization.

I would like to propose suggestions to my supervisor to improve our data management. What kind of advice should I give?

For (1) I think we can have a database. I'm not sure about (2). However, any advice is welcome. I would like to take this opportunity to learn about data science/management/database and significantly improve our data management process.

I see population counts at the census, so what about a culmutive total since 1780? 1 person could be counted potentially multiple times at multiple censuses. Would it essentially be just adding births every year since year xxxx? To get a world population, would that require adding each country birth count? Thanks for any thoughts or suggestions.",1.0,1,0,1,,2023-01-17T12:31:12Z,10ejj3h,t3
