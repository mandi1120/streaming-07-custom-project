"dataanalysis, No flair, 2023-02-18, 09:09:15, 0 hours since last post, Implementing Forecast, Hello Guys,I work in a company where we grasp all data from SAP to a cube, then we import it either to excel or to PowerBi for our reports. Ive been working mainly with powerquery within PowerBi and I want to start drifting more to data science within these apps - still using the cube. I have not seen projects using this source and to manage to use either dnn or any supervised learning algorithms. I would like some orientation of how can I do it within PowerBi if possible, I know theres the option to bring python scripts there but I neither know how to transform data through there."

"dataanalysis, Advice, 2023-02-18, 04:51:17, 1 hours since last post, From PhD student to junior data analyst, Hi all. Im at a bit of a crossroads right now, as Im doing a funded PhD in experimental psychology, but have been offered a junior data analyst job with apparently good conditions. I have spoken to my supervisor and he has offered me both to leave the PhD, how to do it part-time (although I dont know if it would be very viable workload), and to continue without any problems. I am more or less clear that I do not want to continue at the university, but I do not know if it would be better to finish first (I have a little more than 2 years left), and try again to get a job when I finish, or if this opportunity is temporary.What do you think?"
