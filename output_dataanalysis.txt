"dataanalysis, Advice, 2023-02-19, 09:42:03, 0 hours 0 since earlier post, Data analytics vs data science bootcamp?, *tldr: I’m looking for advice on whether to take a data science or data analytics bootcamp. I am concerned about what will be the best job fit for me, what will get me the best salary, and what will be the most secure in terms of the job market. If you do not have time to read the entire post, please leave your general opinion on the matter. Otherwise, see the background section for information on my experience. Thanks in advance!*  Background: I have a bachelors in wildlife ecology with a specialization in quantitative ecology. In undergraduate, I specialized heavily in R coding with a little GIS and I immediately went into graduate school doing macro-level ecology. I dropped out after realizing academia was not what I wanted in life. I’ve spent almost a year applying to data science and data analyst positions with no luck. It always comes down to me and another person with more experience. As a result, I am considering taking one of the bootcamps which my local university offers. I am looking for advice on which I should take. I am concerned about what will be the best job fit for me, what will get me the best salary, and what will be the most secure in terms of the job market.  I lean towards the analytics program as I am confident that I am capable of these skills since I am well trained to do so within R. I also perceive more security in that there are more analysts needed and more positions. Additionally, it appears you gain a more varied skillset, learning SQL, power BI, tableau, etc, versus the data science program which is centric on the python stack. However, I worry that this won’t feel like enough coding as I really loved coding in R and have been looking for a career that feels similar to what I was doing when I worked in R. It also appears that the salaries are slightly lower. I will mention that I know someone who did this program and got a job immediately after. On the other hand, the data science curriculum feels foreign to me  - I am not well informed about machine learning or big unstructured data. I was interested in it in graduate school and was exploring introducing machine learning in my thesis but I never made it past discussing the idea. I love the idea of it, but I fear I wouldn’t be good at it, or that it wouldn’t fit my personality. I don’t view myself as a naturally mathematical person - I enjoy it and find it fulfilling but I have to work hard to learn and understand it. I did well in college but studied hard. I am also concerned that data science jobs will be harder to get with just a bootcamp and no degree.   All this said, do you have any advice or input based on your experience and the background I’ve given? Thanks in advance!"
"dataanalysis, Tutorial, 2023-02-19, 08:34:42, 1 hours 7 since earlier post, How to improve analytical thinking skills?, Hello everyone. I am an aspiring data analyst (also a career shifter) and been in this learning journey since the start of the year.  I am at the point where I am looking to improve my analytical skills. I have more or less knowledge about the tools to use, but I figured my analytical thinking and insight discovery skills need improvement.  Like throughout the tutorials that I followed, instructions were already given out so its a matter of just using the tools. But when I started doing projects (from youtube), I find it hard to form valuable insights. It was overwhelming, and made me realize how clueless I am of actual data analysis.   How can I improve on this aspect? Should I invest time in reading case studies? If so, where can I obtain such resources? Thank you."
