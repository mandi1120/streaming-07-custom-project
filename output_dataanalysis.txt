"dataanalysis, No flair, 2023-02-19, 10:13:13, 0 hr. 0 min. since earlier post, Wondering if experience in web analytics can help me get a job in data analytics (details in the post), Hello everyone,  I am sorry to write a post about getting into the field or shifting careers. I know this subreddit has already seen enough of those, but I want to ask you about my specific situation.  TLDR: I have 1.5 of work experience with Excel, Google Data Studio and web tracking tools (no SQL or Python), want to know if I could use it to enter the field of data analysis having a job gap of 1.5-2 years.  I am 27 and hold a bachelor's degree in international relations. After finishing my studies, I worked in the tourism industry, which was more or less related to my major. Then I decided to change my career and, with some preparation, landed an internship as a web analyst at a European office of a US Google partner agency.  I worked for this company for a little over 1.5 years and reached the mid position. I got experience mainly using Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, Google Data Studio, Excel, and Google Sheets.   It was more of a monkey job than I wanted it to be. My company usually sold a business on building a data warehouse/data lake. For that, the business had to have clean and coherent web tracking. My part would go like this:   1. I audit the client's Google Analytics implementation and find opportunities for improvement.    2. We discuss with the client what has to be done,    3. I write implementation guides in basic javascript to tell client's developers what has to be changed. We go through several cycles of test and prod deployment, then everything should work well enough.    4. We collect data for a month or more, then proceed to compare e-ecommerce tracking data between Google Analytics and their back-end database. I would usually request a back-end data set from the client's developers, so I never had an opportunity to use SQL to export it myself.   5. I check if the data set is good enough to work with/request another one with some changes. If all is good, I clean the data, look for inconsistencies with Data Analytics, and, if there are any, find reasons for them.    6. We either go through several cycles of improving tracking and comparing the data again or finally find the numbers sufficiently close between the back-end and Data Analytics.   7. If everything is alright, then I pass the client over to the data engineering team. I could also be asked to create/maintain some dashboards for the client, usually in Google Data Studio.   So, I had a lot of experience cleaning data in Excel and Google Sheets as I would usually work with Google Analytics data, which wasn't always perfectly tracked, as well as exports from clients' databases, which were all sorts of strange. I didn't have an opportunity to use SQL since I didn't have access to client databases and I never specifically had to use Python, though I started learning it myself and tried to use it for some exploratory data analysis. I also had multiple client calls with C-level executives and developers during those years. My concern is that I don't think I performed enough analysis on my job. The most analytical parts required only to figure out why data is not tracked right or how to improve tracking to better suit a client. I built some dashboards in Data Studio, but those weren't many and I'm not sure Data Studio experience is even appreciated.   In 2021 I quit my job because of burnout and had to leave the country for various reasons, including political persecution. I moved to Ukraine and later fled from Ukraine because of the war. During all this time, I lived on my savings and what I made off odd jobs and crypto (please, don't judge. I'm not urging you to use it).    By now, I have been out of a CV-worthy job for about 1.5 years. I need a real job to apply for a residence permit in a foreign country and I don't want it to be another odd job. I have been so fed up with the job I described above that I didn't even want to consider working with data again, but lately, I've been reading about data analysis and growing interested in a real analyst role.   So my questions to readers are:  1) Do you think my work experience could in any way facilitate finding a job as a data analyst? I am confident that my previous employer can vouch for me and give an abundantly positive recommendation.   2) Could the job gap be a significant obstacle to finding a job and if so, is there any way to mitigate its effect? I could say I was doing crypto with relative success, but I'm not sure that would be an advantage. I've also been thinking of obtaining a Google Data Analyst Professional certificate to show that I at least put some effort into becoming job-ready again. But it would probably take several months or at least weeks (I heard it's rather easy, and I'm not a complete noob), so my job gap would grow even wider until I get it.    3) Would you say there is any hope of landing a job with my experience and some preparation (I will of course learn SQL, improve my Python, and everything else required) in the next 6 months, provided that I can study full-time? And if so, is there any chance of becoming a mid analyst from the start instead of a junior, considering that I already have some relevant experience?   Please do not hesitate to ask for any additional information. I will be here to provide it.   I apologize for writing such a long post and appreciate the time of anyone who would read it even in part, especially of those who will provide some answers. Have a nice day!"

I am concerned about what will be the best job fit for me, what will get me the best salary, and what will be the most secure in terms of the job market. If you do not have time to read the entire post, please leave your general opinion on the matter. Otherwise, see the background section for information on my experience. Thanks in advance!*  Background: I have a bachelors in wildlife ecology with a specialization in quantitative ecology. In undergraduate, I specialized heavily in R coding with a little GIS and I immediately went into graduate school doing macro-level ecology. I dropped out after realizing academia was not what I wanted in life. I’ve spent almost a year applying to data science and data analyst positions with no luck. It always comes down to me and another person with more experience. As a result, I am considering taking one of the bootcamps which my local university offers. I am looking for advice on which I should take. I am concerned about what will be the best job fit for me, what will get me the best salary, and what will be the most secure in terms of the job market.  I lean towards the analytics program as I am confident that I am capable of these skills since I am well trained to do so within R. I also perceive more security in that there are more analysts needed and more positions. Additionally, it appears you gain a more varied skillset, learning SQL, power BI, tableau, etc, versus the data science program which is centric on the python stack. However, I worry that this won’t feel like enough coding as I really loved coding in R and have been looking for a career that feels similar to what I was doing when I worked in R. It also appears that the salaries are slightly lower. I will mention that I know someone who did this program and got a job immediately after. On the other hand, the data science curriculum feels foreign to me  - I am not well informed about machine learning or big unstructured data. I was interested in it in graduate school and was exploring introducing machine learning in my thesis but I never made it past discussing the idea. I love the idea of it, but I fear I wouldn’t be good at it, or that it wouldn’t fit my personality. I don’t view myself as a naturally mathematical person - I enjoy it and find it fulfilling but I have to work hard to learn and understand it. I did well in college but studied hard. I am also concerned that data science jobs will be harder to get with just a bootcamp and no degree.   All this said, do you have any advice or input based on your experience and the background I’ve given? Thanks in advance!"

But when I started doing projects (from youtube), I find it hard to form valuable insights. It was overwhelming, and made me realize how clueless I am of actual data analysis.

Well, when I am physically active my brain is still free to ruminate over the past day at work.  Few days ago, I convinced my partner to take a telescope and go stargazing. It kept my brain occupied and I had the best night sleep, because I actually switched off.  So my question to you DAs is what kind of hobbies do you have?  I am struggling to think of anything that would keep me physically active and my brain occupied at the same time.  These are two pain points for me as a DA - maintaining healthy level of physical activity and keeping myself concentrated on the task."

I am trying to figure out the best way to showcase my sql skills, but I don't know how to format anything and feel a bit lost on github. I created a repository, and i added a file with all of the code and notes involved. it looks something like this:    /\* We are going to be looking at a dataset containing chicago taxi trips.\*/    \--   \--What is the average fare amount for each payment type?   \-- SELECT payment\type, AVG(fare) AS avg\fare\amount FROM \`bigquery-public-data.chicago\taxi\trips.taxi\trips\` GROUP BY payment\type   \-- -  \-What is the average trip distance for each payment type?   \-- SELECT payment\type, AVG(trip\miles) AS avg\trip\distance FROM \`bigquery-public-data.chicago\taxi\trips.taxi\trips\` GROUP BY payment\type   &amp;#x200B;  And so on. But, this doesn't feel quite correct. I see that i can add comments to my code..is that what I should be doing instead? Also, is it possible to upload a viz from tableau public to github to have the case study all in one place?  Thank you!"

I know it's peak season but as an intern, there really isn't much I can do in the office so I use my ""bored"" hour to learn new thing. I really love automating stuff with vba since high school and I instantly fell in love with python when I came across it in my bored hour. I don't really into web dev and stuff, but working with numbers again gave me a goosebump. I already look up what to learn from Al Sweigart and some statistic courses and documentation hoping so I can understand data analysis better, but I also want to ask you guys, in general what do you think I should study in statistic and programming? And if you guys okay, can you share your journey to where you are now loving statistic? thank you"
